# Rush-Hour
APCS Project
By Mitch Clarke, Anderson David, and Julien Zhu.

Rush Hour is a single player game where you shift blocking cars and trucks out of your way to clear a path for the objective car to exit.

Julien finished the logic for movement and put up TwoHorizontalCar. Vertical Cars and ThreeHorizontalCars should be easy to implement now that initial logic is figured out. That is what Anderson is doing right now. We are still friends I think. I should probably figure out some type of sliding mechanism for the thing so that it looks cooler because the button mechanism is a bit "jarring.' Mitch right now is doing some stuff with the levels and editing 10 of them and the two are tasked with creating the thing
