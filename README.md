# Rush-Hour
APCS Project
By Mitch Clarke, Anderson David, and Julien Zhu.

Rush Hour is a single player game where you shift blocking cars and trucks out of your way to clear a path for the objective car to exit.

Julien finished the logic for movement and put up TwoHorizontalCar. Vertical Cars and ThreeHorizontalCars should be easy to implement now that initial logic is figured out.
