Hi guys,

The files I uploaded onto this folder still need some work. Here are some comments:

1. I have javadoced everything on these files so far.

2. The only problem I have yet to fix is the createbackground() method. From our originial board class, I have realized that 
this method needs to be called after everything has been instantiated, but it still would not work when I tried that. If you 
download the code and run it, you will know what I mean when I say it does not work.

3. The background problem aside, the most important task now is to add the cars to the levels. I do not know how we want to do 
this, but there are many options that we have. One though that came to mind for me was to have a class called levelmaker
that extends the RushHourBoard class, wherewe have 10 methods, 1 for each level. Inside each of those methods, we would 
instantiate car objects for each level individually. The levelmaker constructor would call all 10 of these methods. 
Then, in the RushHourBoard class, we could create a levelmaker object, that would automatically call all 10 of these methods
to set up all the levels correctly.
